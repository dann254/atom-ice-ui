Anyone is welcome to contribute to the development of this theme. It can be a lot of work to keep up on, and I'll take help wherever i can get it :)

## Getting The Code

If you're keen to contribute, start by [forking](https://github.com/dann254/atom-ice-ui#fork-destination-box) the repo and cloning it to your computer.

**Note:** To use the development version, you must first install the production version (`apm uninstall atom-ice-ui`), then and run the following commands:

### 3. Create a Pull Request

Once you are satisfied, with your updates, commit your change, push them to your fork and submit a pull request with a description of the changes that you made.

### 4. Unlink
